## 📌 Project Summary

The **AI Email-Drafter Agent** is a lightweight prototype that fine-tunes a transformer language model to generate polite, structured academic emails (e.g., extension requests, recommendation requests, leave requests, clarification emails).  

To make training feasible on commodity GPUs, the project uses **LoRA (PEFT)** adapters on top of **GPT-2 Medium** (causal LM) so that only small adapter weights are trained and stored.

### 🎯 Goals
- Generate emails with a subject, greeting, body and polite closing.  
- Maintain a small storage footprint (LoRA adapters vs full model checkpoints).  
- Provide deterministic post-processing to enforce structure and reduce failure modes.  
- Log full interaction history (prompt → raw output → cleaned output) for reproducibility.

## 🛠️ Design Rationale

- **Base model:** `gpt2-medium` (~345M parameters). Provides a balance of fluency and trainability on a single 8–16 GB GPU.  
- **PEFT / LoRA:** trains small adapters, making the process efficient and storage-friendly.  
- **Tokenizer:** GPT-2 BPE tokenizer with a `[PAD]` token for batching.  
- **Post-processing:** `cleanup_and_validate()` ensures presence of subject, greeting, closing, and normalizes years.  
- **UI:** Gradio-based demo for simple interaction and deployment.

## 🚀 Quick Start — Google Colab

1. Open the main notebook in `Source Code - Python Notebook/` or `Project.ipynb` in **Google Colab**.  
2. Switch runtime to **GPU** (*Runtime → Change runtime type → GPU*).  
3. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   !pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  
4. Run notebook cells in order:  
   - Data preparation  
   - Fine-tuning (Trainer + LoRA)  
   - Evaluation + log generation  
   - Demo UI (Gradio)

## 💻 Quick Start — Local Setup

1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Ai-Email-Agent.git
   cd Ai-Email-Agent
   ```

2. Setup environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate    # macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run notebooks or scripts for training/evaluation.

## 📊 Training

Example command for fine-tuning:
```bash
python src/train_lora.py   --train_file data/train.jsonl   --validation_file data/valid.jsonl   --output_dir lora-output   --model_name_or_path gpt2-medium   --per_device_train_batch_size 1   --gradient_accumulation_steps 8   --num_train_epochs 8   --learning_rate 2e-4   --fp16
```

Or run training directly in Colab.  

---

## ✅ Evaluation & Interaction Logs

1. Prepare `eval.jsonl` in the format:  
   ```json
   {"prompt": "Instruction: ...", "completion": "Subject: ..."}
   ```

2. Run evaluation to generate:  
   ```
   reports/interaction_logs.csv
   ```  

This file contains:  
`prompt, reference_completion, raw_generation, cleaned_generation, valid_flag, settings`

---

## 🎨 Demo UI (Gradio)

Run the Gradio app:
```bash
python src/ui_gradio.py --adapter_dir lora-output --model_name gpt2-medium
```

Or run the Gradio cell in Colab.
